# üåßÔ∏è Australian Cities Rainfall Prediction App

A weather prediction web application that forecasts the **next day's rainfall** for any Australian city using real-time weather data and a trained **machine learning model**. Built as part of a Hackathon by a passionate team of SU students üß†üíª

---

## üßæ Project Overview

This project combines **OpenWeather API**, **Flask**, and **Scikit-learn ML models** to offer rainfall predictions based on user-input city names. The app features:

- Real-time weather data fetching
- Trained machine learning model for rainfall prediction
- Dynamic web interface for user interaction

## üß† Algorithm Overview

1. `index.html` serves as the homepage where the user enters a city name.
2. Input is validated to ensure correct format.
3. Real-time weather data is fetched using **OpenWeather API**.
4. Data is cleaned and prepared for prediction.
5. ML model predicts rainfall based on inputs.
6. Output is displayed to the user dynamically using `weather.html`.

## üíª Features

- üèôÔ∏è Input Australian city name
- üå¶Ô∏è Displays current temperature, humidity, wind, etc.
- üåßÔ∏è Predicts rainfall for the next day
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Handles input errors and invalid city names

---

## üß™ Test Cases

- Tested on multiple cities with diverse weather
- Handles both valid and invalid city entries gracefully
- Tested error handling for API failures
